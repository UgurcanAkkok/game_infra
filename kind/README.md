# Kind
This directory is used for development on a local kubernetes cluster.
You can find helper scripts for metrics, jenkins, metallb etc. along with a working kind configuration.
Before executing the scripts, examine them, use with caution! They are not robust at all.
!!!You need to be in the correct kubernetes cluster/context, otherwise catastrophic things might happen!!!
